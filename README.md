## 🧠 How It Works

### Backend Architecture

The backend uses **LangChain with GPT-4o-mini** for real AI processing:

- **Food Agent**: Analyzes student meals and provides nutritional insights
- **Exercise Agent**: Evaluates physical activities and study breaks
- **Lifestyle Agent**: Assesses sleep, screen time, and stress for student wellness
- **Goal Generator**: Creates personalized health goals for students
- **Personalization Generator**: Creates student-friendly nicknames and avatars

The **Enhanced Orchestrator** coordinates all agents using AI to generate:
- Overall health score (0-10) with student-focused analysis
- Personalized daily summary for student life
- Smart recommendations for academic success and wellness

### API Endpoints

**Authentication:**
- `POST /auth/signup` - Student registration
- `POST /auth/login` - Student authentication
- `GET /user/profile` - Get student profile
- `PUT /user/profile` - Update student profile

**Health Analysis:**
- `POST /generate-summary-from-user-data` - Generate health summary
- `GET /user/{user_id}/progress` - Get student progress

**Educational Content:**
- `GET /api/intellectual/recommendations` - Get educational videos
- `GET /api/intellectual/recommendations/personalized` - Personalized content
- `GET /api/intellectual/categories` - Available subject categories

### Frontend Features

- **Landing Page**: Clean introduction with agent explanations
- **Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of agent outputs and orchestrator summary
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with TailwindCSS
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in and slide-up effects for better UX

## 🎨 Design System

- **Color Palette**: Light pastels with primary (blue) and secondary (purple) gradients
- **Typography**: Inter font family for clean readability
- **Components**: Modular, reusable React components
- **Animations**: CSS transitions and keyframe animations

## 🔧 Development

### Backend Development

The backend uses FastAPI with:
- Pydantic for data validation
- Modular agent architecture
- JSON-based dummy data (no database required)
- CORS enabled for frontend communication

### Frontend Development

The frontend uses Next.js with:
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization (ready for future charts)
- Responsive design patterns

## 🧪 Testing the Pipeline

### Complete User Flow

1. **Start Services**: Run both backend and frontend servers
2. **Visit Landing Page**: Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Input Data**: Click on agent buttons to input your data:
   - 🍎 **Food Agent**: Enter your meals for the day
   - 💪 **Exercise Agent**: Log your physical activities
   - 🌱 **Lifestyle Agent**: Set sleep, screen time, and stress levels
4. **AI Processing**: Watch as GPT-4o-mini analyzes your data
5. **View Results**: See color-coded dashboard with personalized insights

### Color-Coded Visual Feedback

- 🟢 **Green**: Excellent performance (scores 8-10)
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Fair performance (scores 6-7)
- 🔴 **Red**: Needs attention (scores below 6)

### API Testing
