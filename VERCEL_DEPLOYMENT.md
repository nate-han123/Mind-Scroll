## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
**Error: "Cannot find module"**
- Solution: Check that root directory is set to `src/frontend`

**Error: "Build exceeded maximum duration"**
- Solution: Check for infinite loops or large dependencies

### Runtime Errors
**Error: "Failed to fetch"**
- Check browser console
- Verify Railway backend is running
- Check CORS settings (should be fine)

**Error: "CORS policy blocked"**
- Shouldn't happen, but if it does, we need to update Railway CORS settings

1. Buy domain from any registrar
